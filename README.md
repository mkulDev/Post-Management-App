# Post Management App

The **Post Management App** is a web application built with React and Redux for managing and displaying posts authored by various users. This application allows users to view, create, and react to posts. It also demonstrates best practices in structuring a React application, handling asynchronous operations with Redux Thunk, and responsive design using CSS.
